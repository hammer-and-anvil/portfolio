Until recently, computers have always been a hobby. My first "Hello World" involved MS-DOS on a 5.25" floppy, and we used Wordstar to type high school papers. Today, I used ChatGPT on my phone to help configure the SDN in my home.

I've build a couple server towers with SuperMicro boards, Xeon Chips, LSI cards and 30-50T of HHDs running Unraid. I've also played around with running Raspberry Pis in clusters. I just never thought to document that sort of thing for public consumption.

The following projects start after I've completed the Google IT Support Certificate, passed Comptia A+, Security+ and ISC<sup>2</sup> CC. I'm currently studying for Network+ (the test is scheduled for next month) and then SSCP. MY PMP is still out on the horizon, somewhere. While I enjoy Network and SOC, my intrests are leaning more into Incident Management; Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance; or Business Continuity Management.

## Portfolio

> Some of my documents are in PDF format to accommodate advanced formatting, include colorful presentations, and incorporate abundant screenshots for enhanced clarity and detail.

I am developing this cybersecurity portfolio to showcase various tasks and projects that I've completed so far. They have provided insights into:
* Network Architecture, Hardware and Security
* Frameworks and controls that inform security operations
* Incident Management and Risk Management
* SIEM tools for cybersecurity
* Detecting and responding to incidents using an intrusion detection system
* Performing packet capture and analysis
* Ticketing Systems

Additionally, it has paved the path for me to pursue one of the following entry-level roles:
* Cybersecurity Analyst
* Security Analyst
* SOC Analyst
* Information Security Analyst
* IT Security Analyst
* Cyber Defense Analyst
* GRC Analyst
